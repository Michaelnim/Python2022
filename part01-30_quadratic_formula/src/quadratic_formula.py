# Write your solution here
# Let's take the square root of math-module in use
from math import sqrt
import math

# Note that the square root can also be calculated using power.
# sqrt(9) is equivalent to 9 ** 0.5

a = int(input("Value of a: "))
b = int(input("Value of b: "))
c = int(input("Value of c: "))

quad = a^2 + b^1 + c
abs = abs(quad)
sqrt = sqrt(abs)

print(f"The roots are {sqrt} and {quad}")
